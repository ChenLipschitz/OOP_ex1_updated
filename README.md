This project implements a smart elevator's, offline algorithm.

## **The Algorithm:**

The algorithm gets 2 files:
* file with the building's attributes
* file with the call's attributes
this algorithm is offline, which means all the details and parameters are given in advanced.
the algorithm allocates an elevator which travels to the source-floor's-call in the shortest time possible given the following conditions:
if there are several elevators in level-mode and have no calls the algorithm will assign the elevator which will arrive in the shortest time.
if there is no such elevator the algorithm will search for an elevator which is traveling in the same direction as the call's-type (up/down).
in addition the source floor and destination floor must be within the maximum/minimum set range parameters (ex: elevator A is from floor 21 to 35 only).
Out of the above conditions we will select the elevator that will reach it's source-call destination in the shortest time possible.

The articles above inspired us and provided all the required information about elevators and its algorithm for this project.

## **How to run the program:**
To run the program in the SDE:
Download the files above, change in the Ex1.Tester, in the main method, to the relevant building json file and the calls csv file and run. 
A csv file with the allocated elevators (the results) will be created after runnig the program and added to the directory. 

To run the program via cmd:
java -jar Ex1_checker_V1.2_obf.jar 1111,2222,3333 B2.json Ex1_Calls_case_2_b.csv out.log
